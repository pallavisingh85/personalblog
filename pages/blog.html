            <article class="blog">
                <p>Once upon a time, <em>(that's how all tales start, so please excuse the clich√©)</em> in a small town called
                    Huntsville, there lived a girl named Mary. Some used to say that she was the prettiest face they had
                    ever seen. Blue eyes like Sapphire and locks of gold.</p>
                <p>One afternoon, when Mary was filling the pitcher from the well, a local boy from village saw her as he
                    passed by. He stopped and looked at her. <q>Greetings Mary</q>.</p>
                <p>Mary took a glance and then got back to filling the water.
                    <q>Ah.. hmm .. So you seem busy?</q> There was no reciprocation. <q>'Well, did you hear about the beast?'</q>.
                    'Hear what?' Mary replied softly.
                    '<u>They say it's back. Its hunting season has begun.</u>'</p>
                <p>'Hey! Get away from her!' someone screamed in a loud voice. That was Mary's Stepmother (Oh come on! No
                    tale is complete without a step-mom).</p>
                <p>'Mary, How many times do I have to ask you to not talk to strange men? Just fill the pitchers and go
                    home.' she shouted as Mary rushed back, with half the water from the pitcher falling all over the
                    place.</p>
                <p>'They say its back!' whispered Silvia, Mary's stepsister (There is always a Stepsister). 'Its hunting
                    season has begun' she said excitedly. 'Really? Well, there is nothing to be so joyful about. We better
                    be more careful now since...' Mary whispered as she was interrupted.</p>
                <p><q>Mary, Have you made the fire? <strong>Oh! for God sake , stop gossiping and do something worthwhile for a
                    change!</strong> And girls, rumour has it that he is back ... so I don't want any of you to ...</q></p>
                <p>'How do you know its a he .. did you see it?' Silvia started to giggle.</p>
                <p>'Oh this is not a laughing matter. If the bar tender at the other end of the town is to be believed,
                    he said he saw the beast and it was half human.' Silvia's smile vanished.</p>
                <p>'We aren't laughing now, Are we? Now go back to your work.'</p>
